# 🏋️ BMI Calculator using Python

This project is a simple Python program that calculates your BMI based on weight and height.  
It helps determine whether a person is **underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese**, along with associated health risks.

## 📖 About the Project
This BMI Calculator is designed to:
- Take user input for **weight (lbs)** and **height (inches)**
- Calculate the **BMI using the standard formula**
- Classify the user’s BMI into different **weight categories**
- Display the **health risk** associated with the BMI

### **BMI Formula:**

BMI = (weight (lbs) x 703) / (height (inches) ^2)
